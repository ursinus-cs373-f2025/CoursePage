										<p>
											Now that we're getting the hang of regular languages, we'll start thinking about how to combine them together to make more complicated regular languages.  Often, it's easier to design more complicated regular languages in small pieces and then combine them, just like we write modular code.
										</p>

										<p>
											To begin, we'll start with the <b>union</b> of two regular languages.  If we have a regular language <b>L1</b> and a regular language <b>L2</b>, then <b>L1 &cup; L2</b> is the language with strings that are either in <b>L1</b> <b>OR</b> in <b>L1</b>.  In other words, if a DFA <b>M1</b> recognizes <b>L1</b> and a DFA <b>M2</b> recognizes <b>L2</b>, then a string is in the union of <b>L1</b> and <b>L2</b> if and only if at least one of <b>M1</b> or <b>M2</b> accepts this string.  
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "regproof">Proof That The Union of Two Regular Languages is Regular</a></h3>

										<p>
											We can come up with a general strategy for creating a DFA that recognizes <b>L1 &cup; L2</b> by combining the DFAs that recognize each of them.
										</p>

										<h4>Proposition</h4>
										<p>
											The union of two regular languages <b>L1</b> and <b>L2</b> is regular.
										</p>

										<h4>Proof</h4>


										<p>
											We will do a "proof by construction" where we design a DFA <code>M = (Q, &Sigma;, &delta;, q, F)</code> that recognizes <b>L1 &cup; L2</b>. By the <a href = "../Week2_Formal/index.html#reglang">definition of regular languages</a> there exist DFAs <code>M1 = (Q1, &Sigma;, &delta;1, q1, F1)</code> and <code>M2 = (Q2, &Sigma;, &delta;2, q2, F2)</code> that recognize L1 and L2, respectively.  At a high level, we will use the components of <b>M1</b> and <b>M2</b> to design a new machine <b>M</b> that simulates both <b>M1</b> and <b>M2</b> <i>simultaneously</i>, and which accepts if <i>either one or both</i> of <b>M1</b> and <b>M2</b> accepts.  More formally, we have the following components of <b>M</b>:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												<h3>\[ Q = Q_1 \times Q_2 \]</h3> 
												<p>
													In other words, we actually have the machine follow two states at a time: one state in the first machine and one state in the second machine.  If there are <b>M</b> states in the first machine and <b>N</b> states in the second machine, then this is <b>MN</b> possible pairs to consider
												</p>
											</li>
											
											<li>
												<p>
													For simplicity, we'll assume that <b>&Sigma;</b> is the same alphabet for L1, L2, and their union
												</p>
											</li>

											<li>
												The new function is defined as

												<H3>
													\[ \delta( (a, b), x ) = (\delta_1(a, x), \delta_2(b, x)) \]
												</H3>

												<p>
													In other words, we think independently about what the first machine does when it's at state <b>a</b> and receives an <b>x</b> character and what the second machine does when it's at state <b>b</b> and it receives an <b>x</b> character.
												</p>

												<p>
													In <a href = "#example1">example1</a> below, when we're at (q1, podd), we notice that a 0 moves q1 to q0 and a 0 keeps podd at podd; therefore, (q1, podd) has an arrow to (q0, podd) when a zero is inputted.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												The start state is simply 
												<h3>
													\[ q = (q_1, q_2) \] 
												</h3>
												<p>
													That is, we start in the start state of each machine
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												The accept states are all of the states that include an accept in the first machine <b>OR</b> an accept in the second machine.  Said differently, it doesn't matter what state I'm in in the second machine if I'm in an accept state in the first machine: I will accept.  Conversely, it doesn't matter what state I'm in in the first machine if I'm in an accept state in the second machine: I will accept.  We can translate these last two sentences into set notation by saying:

												<H3>
													\[ F = F_1 \times Q_2 \cup F_2 \times Q_1 \]
												</H3>

												<p>
													In <a href = "#example1">example 1</a> below, any state that has a podd in it will accept, regardless of what the first machine is doing.  So we see that (q0, podd), (q1, podd), and (q2, podd) all accept.  Likewise, any state that has a q0 or a q1 in it will accept.  This includes (q0, peven), (q0, podd), (q1, peven), and (q1, podd).
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
											
											
											
										

										<h3><a name = "example1">Example 1</a></h3>
										<p>
											The nice thing about proofs by construction are they give us a way to apply the steps to real examples in a concrete way.  As our first example, let's consider the following two languages
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>L1 = {binary strings with no more than 1 ones}</li>
											<li>L2 = {binary strings with an odd number of zeroes}</li>
										</ol>

										<p>
											Here's a machine that recognizes <b>L1</b> (<a href = "atmost1one.jff">Click here</a> to download JFLAP file)
										</p>
										<img src = "atmost1one.png">
										<p>
											Here's a machine that recognizes <b>L2</b> (<a href = "oddzeros.jff">Click here</a> to download the JFLAP file)
										</p>
										<img src = "oddzeros.png">
										<p>
											Here's a machine that puts them together using the cartesian product (<a href = "atmost1one_or_oddzeros.jff">Click here</a> to view JFLAP file)
										</p>

										<img src = "atmost1one_or_oddzeros.png">

										

										<h3>Example 2</h3>
										<p>
											For one more example, let's consider the machine that accepts binary strings that contain a 01 or binary strings that are divisible by 3.  Below is a machine that recognizes strings that contain a 01 (<a href = "contains01.jff">Click here</a> to download the JFLAP file)
										</p>

										<img src = "contains01.png">

										<p>
											And here's the machine to recognizes binary strings divisible by 3 (<a href = "../Week2_Formal/Div3.jff">Click here</a> to view JFLAP file)
										</p>
										<img src = "../Week2_Formal/Div3.png">

										<p>
											And below is a machine that recognizes the union (<a href = "contains01_or_divby3.jff">Click here</a> to download the JFLAP file)
										</p>

										<img src = "contains01_or_divby3.png">

										<p>
											We can actually simplify this slightly because there are two states that can never be reached from the start:
